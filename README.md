Java Interpreter for Brainfuck

I decided to make an interpreter for Brainfuck just for fun.
I really like these super simple and impractical programming languages.

My implementation allocates 30000 integers in an array to act as the "data tape", so this among other reasons
makes this not the most memory efficient implementation.

I think I will later make a version of the interpreter that dynamically allocates memory as it is needed.
